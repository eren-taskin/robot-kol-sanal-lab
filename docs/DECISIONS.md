## D1 – IPlant takes a vector input

**Context.** Lecture Note 2 defines the plant interface with a scalar input:

```csharp
void Derivatives(double t, double[] x, double u, double[] dx);
```

That fits a single-input plant. The OpenMANIPULATOR-X has four actuated joints, so the input is a vector of four torques (SPEC §2, §6.1).

**Decision.** Our interfaces (PROJECT.md §2, rule 2) are:

```csharp
public interface IPlant
{
    int StateCount { get; }
    int InputCount { get; }
    void Derivatives(double t, ReadOnlySpan<double> x, ReadOnlySpan<double> u, Span<double> dx);
}
public interface ISolver
{
    void Step(IPlant plant, double t, Span<double> x, ReadOnlySpan<double> u, double h);
}
```

**Why.**

- *Vector input.* `u` becomes `ReadOnlySpan<double>` of length `InputCount` (4 for this arm). The course's scalar case is the special case `InputCount = 1`, so nothing in Note 2 is lost.
- *Sizes are declared.* `StateCount` (8) and `InputCount` (4) let a solver size its work buffers once, in its constructor, and let callers check array lengths. The same solver then works for a 6-DOF arm (12 states, 6 inputs) without change.
- *Spans instead of arrays.* `ReadOnlySpan` makes the read-only arguments (`x`, `u`) read-only at compile time, and `Span` makes the outputs (`dx`, the stepped `x`) explicit. Spans let callers pass slices of preallocated buffers, which supports the rule that nothing called once per step allocates (PROJECT.md §3).
- *Input held over the step.* `ISolver.Step` takes `u` once, so the zero-order hold of SPEC §6.2 is part of the contract: every stage of RK4 sees the same input.

**Consequences.** Code from the lecture notes cannot be pasted unchanged; the `u` argument and array types must be adapted. The deviation is also explained in the report.
